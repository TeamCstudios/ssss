<p>[Direct Message / Theo Hill (ThrowingAwayMyShot) &gt; Marietjie Smith (Mariel)]</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Salutations, my aspiring thespian rival.</p>
<p>Mariel: Aspiring? Theo I beat your north side asses in the last three competitions</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Your assessment of our shared competitive record is intentionally disingenuous. Case in point: I did not attend two of the three contests you are referring to, and the third one was a fluke due to a horrific conflict of interest with the presiding judges.</p>
<p>Mariel: Its 2021 and you still listen to hamilton lmao</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: What a bold proclamation, coming from someone living in such the metaphorical glass house as yourself, who decided upon a profile picture of a girl from Touhou Project.</p>
<p>Mariel: I will not have you disrespecting yuuka in my vicinity</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Nonetheless, I did not send contact for the purpose of battling with our digital pens, as entertaining and enjoyable as such an activity is.</p>
<p>Mariel: What do you need</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Have you any knowledge of a user known as @RozkoloraKajVerda#2414?</p>
<p>Mariel: Unfortunately for you no</p>
<p>Mariel: Although</p>
<p>Mariel: I know that that means &ldquo;PinkAndGreen&rdquo; in Esperanto</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Esperanto? What a truly interesting turn of events. I assumed the language in question was some obscure backwater Italian dialect. </p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Regardless, thank you for what feeble attempt you could manage as for actually helping me out of my current predicament.</p>
<p>Mariel: Wow rude</p>
<p>Mariel: Wait what do you mean predicament</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Due to the sensitive nature of the events currently taking place, I will not inform you of the full details of the current happenings.</p>
<p>Mariel: Uh okay</p>
<p>Mariel: I look forward to kicking your ass at the next one act play theo</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Such an outcome only finds its home in the oddest dreams of a miscreant such as yourself.</p>

<p>terminallyContagious: yeah that creeped me the fuck out</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Fear not, friends, for I have asked around about this mysterious user!</p>
<p>StarShatters: whatd you get</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Apparently, the name means &ldquo;Pink And Green&rdquo; in the Esperanto language!</p>
<p>StarShatters: esperanto?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Esperanto is a constructed language, invented by Polish-Jewish doctor Ludwig Lazer Zamenhof in the year eighteen eighty seven. The design philosophy was to create an auxiliary language that can be spoken by people with different mother tounges. It has, based on varying estimates, two million to ten million speakers worldwide. It even has about thirty thousand native speakers!</p>
<p>StarShatters: how do you type that fast</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Being the president of the drama club allows you access to eldritch forces the likeness of which man is not meant to know.</p>
<p>StarShatters: cant argue with that</p>
<p>AceSpades: Let us change the name away from loss.</p>
<p>&gt;@AceSpades has changed the server name to The Server That Shall Not Be Named</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: goddamn HARRY POTTER FAN even worse than liking love live</p>
