<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>The following is the written record of my investigation into these troubling events we&rsquo;ve found ourselves confronting.</p>
<p>This includes several relevant chatlogs (although the relevance of some may be questionable, we erred on the side of including as much as was necessary) from several Discord servers, multiple images, and several audio recordings that provide evidence that might help us make sense of the mess.</p>
<p>Most of this evidence was helpfully gathered by my younger brother Karl Lightman, so thanks go to him that we even have some leads on this case.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Senior Detective X. Lightman</p>

<h2>[Chatlog / Bee&rsquo;s Hive (Wasps Only)]</h2>
<p>AceSpades: This server is dreadfully inactive.</p>
<p>AceSpades: @everyone</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Why.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: It&rsquo;s SEVEN A.M. Ace.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Here is a fun idea.</p>
<p>AceSpades: What is your favorite anime, everyone?</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: what kind of question is THAT?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Steven Universe?</p>
<p>AceSpades: That is not an anime.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Thenceforth, I do refuse to participate in this trivium.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: is &lsquo;thenceforth&rsquo; even a word?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: That, my wonderfully degenerate friend, is something you must find out for yourself.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: wow what a polite way to say fuck you.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: &gt;;)</p>
<p>StarShatters: what are we talking about</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: did you JUST NOW wake up NOAH?</p>
<p>StarShatters: immediate aggression from caroline</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: call me caroline again and I will BREAK your BONES.</p>
<p>StarShatters: okay!!!!</p>
<p>AceSpades: @StarShatters we are each listing our favorite anime, although Theo decided they were too good for it</p>
<p>StarShatters: mine is bnha</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: basic bitch</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: mine is evangelion.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: sis</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: I know you have an almost omnipresent hypocrisy streak.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: But you somehow managed to outdo your past shadows in terms of hypocrisy in the space of five measly words.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Well done.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: SHUT THE FUCK UP THEODORE</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: ouch you need some burn cream there</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: anyway my favorite anime is Ninjago</p>
<p>StarShatters: what</p>
<p>AceSpaces: the</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: FUCK</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Not joking or exaggerating.</p>
<p>AceSpades: This is why no one likes you, Jo.</p>
<p>StarShatters: no let him explain himself</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: It&rsquo;s produced in Denmark, and is dubbed to wide release elsewhere. The voice actors on it mostly do anime dubbing anyway, and it stylistically and tropewise resembles most shonen anime. </p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: WORST take I have ever seen let me go die rq</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: @AceSpades you haven&rsquo;t contributed to the discussion you started.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Neither has @DetectiveProfessorK.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Stop dodging the question you asked.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Fine. My favorite is Love Live.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: wh-</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: degenerate</p>
<p>StarShatters: for once I agree with her</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: fuck you too noah</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Why Was I Pinged Twice.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: As always, our night-owl true crime slut cannot be bothered to backread. Absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Oh. I Did Not Read Up. My Favorite Anime Is Death Note, and Please Do Not Ping Me Like That I See The Messages.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: God every SINGLE message he sends gives me whiplash but it also makes me read it in his FUCKING VOICE.</p>
