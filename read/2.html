<p>AceSpades: No.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: five WEEBS and a fucking PIG</p>
<p>AceSpades: Perfect.</p>
<p>&gt;@AceSpades has changed the server name to Five Weebs and a Pig</p>
<p>StarShatters: ndoawudnawkdjnawdkljbawd!!!</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: idk maybe JANTCK?</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: the FUCK</p>
<p>AceSpades: Is that supposed to be a RWBY team name or something? </p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Yeah.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: (J)onathan Kretz (A)cerola Spades (N)oah Starbury (T)heodore Hill (C)aroline Hill (K)arl Lightman</p>

<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: DIE IN A WHOLE</p>
<p>&gt;@AceSpades has <strong>muted</strong> @NoTalkMeIAngy for <strong>60 minutes</strong>: quit being a bitch</p>
<p>AceSpades: Enough of that for a while.</p>
<p>StarShatters: aw she was about to admit her feelings</p>
<p>AceSpades: Do not push her please, she can still read the chat.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: While my absolutely wonderful sister is silenced by the austentatious use of administrator priviledges,</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: I would like to postulate that both of you were, in truth, dramatically missing the point.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: how so?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: I have only watched the series a few times, but this much is clear to me; the names of characters and teams are precisely crafted to evoke a chromatic postulation.</p>
<p>StarShatters: sorry my theo-to-english software is broke today</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: I think they&rsquo;re trying to say it&rsquo;s supposed to be a color or make you think of a color.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Precisely.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: but what would you suggest theo?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Hmm&hellip;</p>

<p>terminallyContagious: Ablicant?</p>
<p>AceSpades: Google says &ldquo;<strong>albicant</strong>&nbsp;(not comparable) (rare) Growing or becoming white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ThowingAwayMyShot: It fulfills all the requirements. It is evocative of a color, it has the leader&rsquo;s name word-initially, and it sounds cool.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Yeah I like that.</p>
<p>StarShatters: that is hype</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Did I Miss Something?</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Why Is the Server Now Called &ldquo;Five Weebs and a Pig&rdquo;</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: I Would Assume That I Am The &ldquo;Pig&rdquo;?</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: ig that matches up with kara&rsquo;s humor</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Did We Not Just Eight Hours Ago Have the Favorite Anime Conversation Where I Mentioned That My Favorite Anime Is Death Note.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: lmfao is her memory that shortterm</p>
