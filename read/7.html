<p>[Chatlog / The Server That Shall Not Be Named]</p>
<p>StarShatters: so do you remember anything</p>
<p>AceSpades: Well, I was walking to the mailboxes at my apt complex and I got hit in the back of the damn head.</p>
<p>AceSpades: That&rsquo;s all I remember.</p>
<p>StarShatters: go to the manager to see if they have security footage or something</p>
<p>StarShatters: so long as youre okay obviously</p>
<p>AceSpades: Yeah, I&rsquo;m alright and that&rsquo;s probably a good idea.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Is it just me, or does shit seem to have hit the fan?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: At high velocity.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Fuck.</p>
<p>StarShatters: what happened ace</p>
<p>AceSpades: Turns out I&rsquo;m far from the only one having a problem right now.</p>
<p>StarShatters: how so</p>
<p>AceSpades: The apartment complex manager is chewing out these three fuckboys, two of them look injured.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Apparently one of them stole something from some dude named Ross, and he and some of his friends decided to get some payback.</p>
<p>StarShatters: what, like THAT ross?</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: what are you TALKING ABOUT noah</p>
<p>StarShatters: oh shit im talking like you now caroline ;)</p>
<p>StarShatters: anyway this dude i went to middle with</p>
<p>StarShatters: well known for getting in fights, getting suspended, all that shit</p>
<p>StarShatters: apparently now they call him Terror Rossy or something like that</p>
<p>AceSpades: yep</p>
<p>AceSpades: We&rsquo;re definitely talking about the same dude, someone just mentioned that nickname.</p>
<p>StarShatters: i mean everyone knew not to fuck with that guy</p>
<p>StarShatters: maybe he had it out for you for some reason?</p>
<p>AceSpades: I doubt it, I&rsquo;d never even heard of him before.</p>
<p>AceSpades: BRB I&rsquo;ll update you once I have more info</p>
<p>StarShatters: okay</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: @StarShatters fuck you</p>
<p>StarShatters: ;)</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: jesus fuck. get a damn room, you two</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: ^</p>
<p>&gt;NoTalkMeIAngy <strong>left the server.</strong></p>
<p>StarShatters: dammit guys look what you did</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: To be fair to my wonderfully socially inept friend here, he was surprisingly totally correct about the course of action that ought to have been taken in this situation.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Surprisingly???</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Take the compliement, miscreant.</p>
<p>StarShatters: @terminallyContagious if you try to wingman me again im blocking you</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: ok I won&rsquo;t but that wasn&rsquo;t even what I was doing lmao</p>
<p>StarShatters: @ThrowingAwayMyShot you arent helping</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: But of course, I only want what is best for my dear sister, despite her&hellip; temper issues.</p>
<p>StarShatters: thanks for the sibling endorsement theo but youre kinda just pissing her off more</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: But of course, twins have a documented tendency to engage in such a thing.</p>
<p>StarShatters: eh fair enough</p>
<p>AceSpades: new information</p>
<p>StarShatters: spill</p>
<p>AceSpades: So the events went like this, as far as I can tell: Thing #2 gets into a shouting match with Ross at 7/11 at approximately 11 PM last night. Thing #1 goes in to steal his headphones, for some fucking reason I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m not that kinda dumbass. Thing #3 revs up his car to get the other two out of there. Then at 5 pm, Ross and this one other guy beat the door lock on Thing #1&rsquo;s apartment open. They fight, Ross gets his headphones by smacking Thing #1 in the face, Thing #2 punches the other guy but breaks his damn fingers. </p>
<p>AceSpades: They&rsquo;re calling a fucking ambulance this is so stupid. Anyway, Ross and the other guy immediately book it out of there. Thing #3 is now pissed at the other two because Ross keyed his car while he was being the getaway driver for the other two dumbasses.</p>
<p>StarShatters: do you know their names</p>
<p>AceSpades: I refuse to.</p>
<p>StarShatters: so it was ross that attacked you</p>
<p>AceSpades: Probably, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me.</p>
<p>StarShatters: hmm</p>
<p>AceSpades: I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t involved in that incident. Hell if I&rsquo;d walk into a 7/11 willingly. Also, who was the person trolling us?</p>
<p>StarShatters: i mean it might have been ross fucking with us</p>
<p>StarShatters: i was in a discord server he pulled a long con on once it was a wild ride</p>
<p>StarShatters: he pretended to be a 12 year old girl to mess with one of the mods who was probably a pedo. the guy asked for pictures and then ross leaked the dms, but only ross got banned &lsquo;for violating discord terms of service&rsquo;</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Wait, really?</p>
<p>StarShatters: yeah true story</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: What happened to the server after that?</p>
<p>StarShatters: i left obviously</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: oh</p>
