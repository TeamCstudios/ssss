<p>StarShatters: and jo&rsquo;s just like that</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: honestly I thought that Theo was only a DRAMATIC BITCH around me until I realized that&rsquo;s just HOW THEY TALK</p>
<p>StarShatters: i have never been so sufficiently fucked up by an insult except from them</p>

<h2>[Chatlog / Five Weebs and a Pig]</h2>
<p>StarShatters: so the weirdest fucking thing happened</p>
<p>StarShatters: there is a letter on my front doorstep</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Contrary to popular belief, corporations and institutions do in fact still send snail-mail in the year of our lord twenty twenty-one.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: god I&rsquo;m talking like Theo now.</p>
<p>StarShatters: no okay so</p>
<p>StarShatters: its not spam mail</p>
<p>StarShatters: my name is written on it in this pretty handwriting</p>
<p>StarShatters: look [Image of a letter in Noah&rsquo;s hand. On it is written &ldquo;For Noah S. Starbury &lt;3&rdquo; in calligraphic handwriting, appearing to have been written using a pink-ink pen.]</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: Well. That is strange.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: what the FUCK noah</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: wait there&rsquo;s a HEART on it is it a LOVE letter</p>
<p>AceSpades: Are you jealous?</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: ACEROLA SPADES YOUR INSINUATION IS STUPID</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: I was just CURIOUS.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: @StarShatters open it.</p>
<p>StarShatters: alright i will</p>
<p>StarShatters: HEY WHAT THE FUCK</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: what does it say</p>
<p>AceSpades: What does it say?</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: A love letter? How ingtrigueifying! </p>
<p>terminallyContagious: @AceSpades jinx</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: &ldquo;How ingtrigueifying!&rdquo;? you&rsquo;re just MAKING UP WORDS at this point!</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: @NoTalkMeIAngy all words that we in America, especially, use in the zeitgeist of today, were neologisms at one point or another. That utterance was certainly dropped upon most words in current parlance.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: quiet, Shakespeare, I want to see what this letter says.</p>
<p>StarShatters: okay holy shit</p>
<p>StarShatters: [Image of a handwritten letter, on fancy stationery. The words are written in the same handwriting style and color as the address on the front. It reads:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>It&rsquo;s been quite the journey, my love.</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>I hope new horizons are finding you well.</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>I haven&rsquo;t been in contact for some time but</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>you should know that you are still my raison d'&ecirc;tre.</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>I still haven&rsquo;t forgotten.</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Love you lots,</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Your Not-So Secret Admirer</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>P.S. A bient&ocirc;t, mon amour &lt;3</em></p>
<p>]</p>
<p>AceSpades: aww thats sweet</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: That is? Really fucking creepy?</p>
<p>StarShatters: i dont know what to think about it honestly</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Oh, I know.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: ~Every breath you take / Every move you make~</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: Every bond you break, every step you take</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: ~I&rsquo;ll be watching you~</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: Every move you make, every vow you break</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: ~Every smile you fake / Every claim you stake~</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: I&rsquo;ll be watching you&hellip;</p>
<p>AceSpades: Guys cut it out.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: aw man that kinda Stings</p>
<p>&gt;@AceSpades has <strong>muted</strong> @terminallyContagious for <strong>120 minutes</strong>: no.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Man you should be glad you get love letters at all @StarShatters whoever wrote this clearly cares a lot about you.</p>
<p>StarShatters: yeah but</p>
<p>StarShatters: it makes absolutely no sense</p>
<p>StarShatters: &ldquo;i havent forgotten&rdquo; and &ldquo;i havent been in contact for some time&rdquo; kinda implies its someone who knew me in the past</p>
<p>StarShatters: but i legit do not know who that i have ever met would be (a) this melodramatic (b) such a hopeless romantic jesus christ calm down and (c) go to the effort to mail me a handwritten letter</p>
<p>AceSpades: You are a lucky bastard is what it means.</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Hold On.</p>
<p>AceSpades: He speaks?</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: @StarShatters You Did Say &ldquo;Mail Me a Letter&rdquo; Right</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: But How Can That Letter Have Been Mailed; There Is No Postage Stamp On It. </p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Someone Physically Delivered That To Your Front Door.</p>
<p>StarShatters: oh fuck</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: Even CREEPIER wow.</p>
<p>NoTalkMyIAngy: NOAH you should call the POLICE.</p>
<p>StarShatters: huh?</p>
<p>AceSpades: But why?</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: I Am Well Versed In Law; I Am Completely Certain Giving Someone a Letter Is Not a Criminal Offense.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: PIG</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Oh Also.</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: The French Phrase In the Post Script Reads Something Like &ldquo;See You Later My Love&rdquo; Or Maybe &ldquo;I Will See You Sometime Soon My Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>StarShatters: thank you karl but i think i got the gist of it the first time reading thru</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: I Thought I Would Say That In Case Someone Here Has No Knowledge of French.</p>
<p>StarShatters: i took two years at southside middle but i mostly ignored it</p>
<p>StarShatters: i still have something resembling knowledge of the language of romance</p>
<p>StarShatters: oh so thats why she(?) wrote in french</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Also I Have a Message For All of ALKCNT.</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: This Weekend I Am Going To Be Going On a Training For Detective Work. I Will Not Be Available During This Time. If My Assistance Is Absolutely Required Please Call Me On My Phone.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: Are we REALLY called ALKCNT now lmao</p>
<p>AceSpades: That is great @DetectiveProfessorK good luck!</p>
<p>StarShatters: good 4 u</p>
<p>DetectiveProfessorK: Thank You Friends and Caroline.</p>
<p>NoTalkMeIAngy: WOW.</p>
