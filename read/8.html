<p>terminallyContagious: Kara?</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: Thats my NAME. Don&rsquo;t wear it out.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: anyway</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: ANYWAY.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: @AceSpades are you OKAY after all that BULLSHIT</p>
<p>AceSpades: Uh&hellip; I guess.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: I mean do you need MEDICAL ATTENTION, that kind of okay.</p>
<p>AceSpades: No no just bruises and scrapes no bleeding. I&rsquo;ll have to sit down for a while but I am a-ok. It&rsquo;ll take more than just one sucker punch to land me in the hospital, trust me.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: You&rsquo;re an OVERCONFIDENT DICKWEED, but that&rsquo;s good, at least.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: One POSITIVE outcome of this situation.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: anyway, anything else to report?</p>
<p>AceSpades: I&rsquo;m having the manager look at the security footage for me.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: yes yes good idea</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Suspicious criminals nevertheless are caught by the wonders of modern technology.</p>
<p>AceSpades: This is weird.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: SPILL</p>
<p>AceSpades: So she found the period where I got knocked out. The camera feed seems to have been deleted for approximately ten seconds between me standing there minding my own business and sitting there on my side knocked out.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Hark! It seems I have spoken too soon! I will decamp to sulk elegantly about my foolishness!</p>
<p>AceSpades: But that&rsquo;s not even the weirdest part. For the next two minutes there&rsquo;s a black box &ndash; like a censor(?) &ndash; on the top half of the frame, and when you skip past it there&rsquo;s just my phone there on the ground.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: so this person is a hacker?</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: not incongruous with what we know about T. Rossy</p>
<p>StarShatters: incongruous? Jo? Really?</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: fuck now im talking like theo gonna go die rq</p>
<p>AceSpades: No, not a hacker. These are CCTV -&nbsp; i.e. Closed Circuit &ndash; not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: oh fuck</p>
<p>AceSpades: They&rsquo;re starting an investigation about it now but I need to sit the fuck down because I took quite a beating.</p>
<p>StarShatters: get well soon</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: yeah, but we still need to investigate this</p>
<p>StarShatters: how</p>
<p>AceSpades: How?</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: HOW</p>
<p>StarShatters: jynx</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: FUCK</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: well its simple really</p>

<p>terminallyContagious: well i tried</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: [Image: Screenshot of the direct message conversation we just saw.]</p>
<p>StarShatters: did you think that was going to work</p>
<p>AceSpades: Well that&rsquo;s weird&hellip; either they&rsquo;re fucking with you because you&rsquo;re, well&hellip; you, or there&rsquo;s something more fucked up going on here.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: I&rsquo;d hazard a guess on the latter, Acerola. While harassing Jonathan is always entertaining, in this case his attempt, though not enlightening, did give us valuable information to further investigation.</p>
<p>terminallyContagious: :/</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: valuable HOW theo</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: That remains to be seen. But it has an air of importance and foreboding.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: you are TESTING my PATIENCE here</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: I cannot control your patience, dear sister. That is encumbered solely on you.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: grr</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Anyway, we ought to reconvene posthaste if we find more information or more developments occur.</p>
<p>StarShatters: are you really saying shit like posthaste in a serious situation</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Yes.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Speaking of the fine art of investigation. Someone ought to contact our fine detective friend.</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: But he said he was OFFLINE the whole WEEKEND.</p>
<p>ThrowingAwayMyShot: Offline on the Discord, yes. But he specifically said we could call him if an urgent occasion sprung forth, and I&rsquo;m sure the current happenings qualify.</p>
<p>AceSpades: Who&rsquo;s gonna call him?</p>
<p>StarShatters: uh</p>
<p>StarShatters: does anyone actually have his number?</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: UH OH</p>
<p>SummerSoryu: we&rsquo;re FUCKED</p>
